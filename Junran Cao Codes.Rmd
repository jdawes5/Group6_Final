## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(gridExtra)
library(tidyverse)  
library(corrplot)
library(ezids)
library(httr)
library(randomForest)
library(tree)

```{r}
dataset=read.csv("C:\\Users\\Lenovo\\Desktop\\US_Accidents_Dec20_updated.csv")
dataset <- na.omit(dataset)
df=dataset
```
Preprocessing and cleaning
```{r}
df=subset(df,select=c(Severity, Amenity,Bump, Crossing,Give_Way, Junction, No_Exit, Railway, Roundabout,Station, Stop, Traffic_Calming, Traffic_Signal, Turning_Loop))
str(df)
df=as.data.frame(df)
df$Amenity = factor(df$Amenity)
df$Bump=factor(df$Bump)
df$Crossing=factor(df$Crossing)
df$Give_Way=factor(df$Give_Way)
df$Junction=factor(df$Junction)
df$No_Exit=factor(df$No_Exit)
df$Railway=factor(df$Railway)
df$Roundabout=factor(df$Roundabout)
df$Station=factor(df$Station)
df$Stop=factor(df$Stop)
df$Traffic_Calming=factor(df$Traffic_Calming)
df$Traffic_Signal=factor(df$Traffic_Signal)
df$Turning_Loop=factor(df$Turning_Loop)
df$Severity=as.factor(df$Severity)
head(df)
```
Note: After reviewing the structure of the data set, we found out that "Turning_Loop" only had one level, meaning that the values of it were all "False".Therefore, we excluded it from our analysis for now. 

Analysis - Logistic Regression

```{r}
loadPkg("MASS")
dfLogit <- polr(Severity ~ Amenity+Bump+Crossing+Give_Way+Junction+No_Exit+Railway+Roundabout+Station+Stop+Traffic_Calming+Traffic_Signal, data = df, Hess = "TRUE")
dfLogit
summary(dfLogit)
(ctable <- coef(summary(dfLogit)))
p <- pnorm(abs(ctable[, "t value"]), lower.tail = FALSE) * 2
(ctable <- cbind(ctable, "p value" = p))
xkabledply( confint.default(dfLogit), title = "CIs using standard errors" )
expcoeff = exp(coef(dfLogit))
xkabledply( as.table(expcoeff), title = "Exponential of coefficients in Logit Reg" )
```
"Traffic_calming", "Stop", "Give-way",and "Railway" were not significant (P-value greater than 0.05)

If the 95% CI does not cross 0, the parameter estimate can be statistically significant.Therefore, "Bump", "Round_about", "Traffic_Signal", "Station", and "Traffic_Calming" were not statistically significant.

Interpretation:

When there was an amenity, the odds of the accident being more severe (i.e.,4, 3,2 versus 1) was 1.084 times that of the accidents which had no amenity, holding constant all other variables.

When there was a crossing, the odds of the accident being more severe (i.e.,4, 3,2 versus 1) was 1.224 times that of the accidents which had no crossing, holding constant all other variables.

When there was a junction, the odds of the accident being more severe (i.e.,4, 3,2 versus 1) was 2.767 times that of the accidents which had no junction, holding constant all other variables.


When there was traffic-signal, the odds of the accident being more severe (i.e.,4, 3,2 versus 1) was 2.061 times that of the accidents which had no traffic-signal, holding constant all other variables.

Model Evaluation

```{r}
loadPkg("pscl") # use pR2( ) function to calculate McFadden statistics for model eval
admitLogitpr2 = pR2(dfLogit)
admitLogitpr2
unloadPkg("pscl") 
```
According to the McFadden statistics, only 1.36% of the variations in y is explained by the explanatory variables in the model. This result urged us to look at other variables.
